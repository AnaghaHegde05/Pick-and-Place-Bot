**Project Spotlight: Pick-and-Place Robot**

As part of **Engineering Exploration** course, to design and build a **Pick-and-Place Robot**, a system capable of transferring objects between predefined points with precision and efficiency.

**Project Journey:**
ðŸ”¹ **Problem Definition:** Identified the challenge of automating repetitive material handling tasks to save time and improve accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ **Concept Generation & Evaluation:** Explored multiple design alternatives, evaluating them based on feasibility, efficiency, and cost.
ðŸ”¹ **Product Architecture:** Defined the mechanical and electronic structure for smooth operation.
ðŸ”¹ **Virtual Implementation:** Modeled the design in **Autodesk CAD**, simulating movement and identifying potential bottlenecks.
ðŸ”¹ **Physical Implementation:** Built the robot using **Arduino-based controls**, integrating sensors and motors for accurate pick-and-place operations.
ðŸ”¹ **Embodied Energy Analysis:** Assessed energy efficiency and optimised the design for sustainability.

**Skills Developed & Applied:**

* Design Thinking & Systems Thinking
* Mechanical Design & Mechanisms
* Electronics Integration & Microcontroller Programming
* Project Management & Documentation
* Team Collaboration & Presentation

**Tools & Technologies:**
